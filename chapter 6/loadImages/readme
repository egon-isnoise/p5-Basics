these are functions to upload images

sketches with external files are A REAL BITCH
always, and I repeat ALWAYS put ALL the files needed in the same 
folder as the .js file AND the index.html AND the images AND 
the p5 library file, otherwise NOTHING loads.
and I swear NOTHING. I tried infinite combinations and there is no way whatsoever
